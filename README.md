# SilenceSprout

## Description
Plugin to blur forbidden words in chat.
Works on the principle of letter combinations.
(ex. ```“Пидорасы” -> “#####асы”```, see default config.)
Keluashi, I know you think this idea is bullshit, but I'm too bored, because
I woke up at fucking 4am, and now I have nothing fucking to do,
and I wanted to try writing in kotlin. Here's what I got.
The plugin is obviously not finalized,
obviously won't be used,
but boredom is what it is. I love
